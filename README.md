# Karma-jasmine-imagediff

## by Chris Finch

Dirty adapter for using [js-imagediff](https://github.com/HumbleSoftware/js-imagediff) with [Karma and require.js](https://npmjs.org/package/karma-requirejs)

Requires [lib cairo](https://github.com/LearnBoost/node-canvas/wiki/_pages) to be installed for the  node package to work. `brew install cairo` works well. You may also need dependancies of cairo `brew install fontconfig`...

If anything fails read the wiki here to instructions for your OS: https://github.com/LearnBoost/node-canvas/wiki/_pages
